<p><strong>TITLE</strong><strong>: </strong><strong><u>AUTHENTICATION ON CALL PROCESS</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>DATED:</strong> <strong><u>17<sup>th</sup> AUGUST 2017</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>INDEX No : </strong><strong><u>CCPROCESS170817001</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Why is the bank progressing with this project?</strong></p>

<p>Currently CBCI system is used for handling customer queries and x-selling post performing successful level checks with the customer. In various processes the customers are required to send in writer requests which customers find inconvenient to provide for any change or modification on their card account. To avoid any inconvenience to the customer &amp; at the same time to a have more robust, authentic &amp; non disputable customer validation process whereby limiting fraudsters intervention, an IVR authentication process has been initiated.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><u>SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGES:</u></strong></p>

<p>The CBCI application has been enhanced on 20<sup>th</sup> April 2012 to support this authentication project. Due to this all users would have now noticed certain additional new details displayed on the CBCI screen post login.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><u>WHAT IS THE CHANGE NOW DUE TO AUTHENTICATION?</u></strong></p>

<p>Currently actioning of maintenances &amp; x-selling are done on the account post level check verification with the customer. With authentication now live, the customer validation will now be done basis One Time Password (OTP) or ATM PIN which the customer themselves will key in through their phone. Hence the customers are now assured that they account is managed in a more secured manner.</p>

<p><strong><u>SYSTEM LEVEL MAINTENANCE:</u></strong></p>

<p>The AOC process will allow either of the below combinations -</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li class="MsoNormal">ATM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PIN</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal">OTP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(One Time Password).</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal">Level &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Checks</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>IVR Authentication flag can be set for either the entire call or mapped only for the particular process at link level.</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Entire &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Call &ndash;</strong> The authentication result will be &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;valid till the user ends the call.</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Link &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Level &ndash;</strong> The validity of authentication &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;result will be only for that particular link.</li>
</ul>

<p>At PhoneBanking, we will be using both these option while at CVM team the &lsquo;link level&rsquo; option will be used.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><u>HOW TO PROCEED WITH AUTHENTICATION:</u></strong></p>

<p>Customer calls PhoneBanking on a query and the process will continue as per the existing level check process. Any maintenance or fulfillment of X-sell product will require the customer to clear the new authentication process before the request can be actioned in CBCI.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Before commencing the authentication process for the customer, the Customer Services Representative will need to check whether the process requires an OTP and / or ATM PIN. (Also should check if the process allows for Level Check option to be used.) &nbsp;This can be identified in the below screen.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Basis the required maintenance, the Customer Services Representative will need to check with the customer if they already have the PIN details with them handy at the moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>For cases where the customer requires an OTP, the Customer Services Representative will need to generate an OTP for the customer by clicking on the below link.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>A new pop up will now be displayed for the Customer Services Representative which will mention the last 4 digits of the mobile number to which the OTP will be despatched.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>The Customer Services Representative will need to confirm this detail with the customer and then click the OK tab. The OTP will be immediately despatched <u>only to the registered mobile number of the customer</u>. Here the OTP will not be sent to the customer e-mail id like in VBV MS process.</p>

<p>AAN based AOC OTP will be different from that Credit card based AOC OTP.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal">Once &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the authentication OTP is used, the OTP becomes inactive and cannot be &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;used once again.</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal">If &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the customer enters the OTP incorrectly, then the customer can use the same &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OTP once again up to 3 attempts. Post the 3<sup>rd</sup> attempt the OTP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;becomes invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong><u>AUTHENTICATION &ndash; CALL PROCESS:</u></strong></p>

<p>Post customer receiving the OTP, the below authentication process can be commenced by the Customer Services Representative &ndash;</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal">Press &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the flash button on the phone. Now the customer&rsquo;s line will be on hold and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the customer will hear the IVR hold music.</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal">Now &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dial the short code (applicable for the respective RCC&#39;s) and the call &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will get connected to the IVR. Customer is still on hold here.</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal">The &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IVR will prompt the team member to enter the caller id as displayed on the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CBCI screen. The user will need to enter the caller id followed by the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FLASH key.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal">On &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;entering the caller id and the FLASH key the customer will be conferenced &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the call and the IVR will voice out the welcome script as &ldquo;<em>Welcome to HDFC Credit Card &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;authentication system</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal">There &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;after the customer will need to follow the IVR prompts and key in the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;details as required. The Customer Services Representative will remain &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;connected on call and will be in the conference and will be able to hear &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the customer and the IVR prompts. If required the Customer Services &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Representative can also speak with the customer and guide the customer on &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the details that is to be entered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>EXTENSION NUMBER NOT TO BE SET IN CBCI:</u></strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal">It is extremely important &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that the <strong><u>users should not set*</u></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; extension numbers for their AD ID by clicking <strong>User Detail -&gt; Set &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Extension</strong> and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;adding extension number in New Extension field in CBCI.</li>
